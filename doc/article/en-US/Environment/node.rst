Currently we are using **version 6.11.0**

Download the installer from `nodejs.org <https://nodejs.org/download/release/v6.11.0/>`_.  
Run the installer and accept the defaults.

Confirm node is installed by checking the node version.

    node -v 

The node installer also installs npm. 
You can confirm this by typing
